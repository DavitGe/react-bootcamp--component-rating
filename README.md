## Overview

Here is 'React bootcamp' challenge from I Basket.

Project is generated by `npx create-react-app`.
I had figma design - [https://www.figma.com/file/H4J9EtA1UHDgvSHEv9ZJss/interactive-rating-component?node-id=0%3A1468]

There are only two components in design, which are stored in `./src/component` folder and imported into `./src/App.js`.

I used react hooks to:

- store user input
- check if user submitted choice

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating
